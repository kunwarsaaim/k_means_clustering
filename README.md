# k_means_clustering
+ First we initialize k points, called means, randomly.
+ We categorize each item to its closest mean and we update the meanâ€™s coordinates, which are the averages of the items categorized in that mean so far.
+ We repeat the process for a given number of iterations and at the end, we have our clusters.
